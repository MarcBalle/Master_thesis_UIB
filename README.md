# Master_thesis_UIB

This repository contains the work I am doing for my final thesis in the Master's program in Intelligent Systems at UIB. I will upload different models as I complete them. 

My final thesis is being carried out in collaboration with CINAC center of HM Hospitals in Madrid. It consists in building an algorithm capable of segmenting a lesion located in the brain using MRI images of different modalities (T1, T2, and SWI).
